NOTE: The papers found in "user_repo" and "technical_repo" files are those that had a "hit" for potential repositories by our script. In these cases, we checked the paper contents to see if there was a repo. For some papers, there was no repo (depite triggering a 'hit') so we still left them here (for instance, this is the case for the "dynamics of blockchain implementation" paper in 2018: this "user study" paper was a false positive and had no repo). Furthermore, some papers that are part of the "user_repo" file have a repository that contains only code. However, they still perform a user study but they do not publish user-study-related materials.
