NOTE: The papers found in "user_repo" and "technical_repo" files are those that had a "hit" for potential repositories by our script. In these cases, we checked the paper contents to see if there was a repo. For some papers, there was no repo (depite triggering a 'hit') so we still left them here (for instance, this is the case for the "dynamics of blockchain implementation" paper in 2018: this "user study" paper was a false positive and had no repo). Furthermore, some papers that are part of the "user_repo" file have a repository that contains only code. However, they still perform a user study but they do not publish user-study-related materials.

NOTE #2: After the acceptance of the paper, following a comment by the reviewers, we have repeated our analyses once more to ensure that every paper was assigned to the correct category. We did so by going over all papers again -- without any pre-existing knowledge of the category they had been assigned in the paper. The updated numbers are as follows: there are 759 technical papers, 1028 user studies, and 182 papers fall in both categories. Nonetheless, despite this minor change in our classification (w.r.t. the numbers in the paper), our conclusions do not change: the number of papers with functional repositories is still below 3% (indeed, verification and checking of the repositories followed a different procedure)
